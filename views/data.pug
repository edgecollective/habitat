p.high <b>Private Key:</b> [Secret]
p.high <b>Home Page</b>: <a href="/data/#{feed_pubkey}">#{base_url}/data/#{feed_pubkey}</a>

p (In the future, you can always access this feed at its <a href="/data/#{feed_pubkey}">Home Page</a>.) 

ul 
li The feed's <b>Public Key</b> is a long, random string used to identify the feed. NOTE: this provides a simple, but realtively weak sort of privacy -- if you want to keep the data relatively private, avoid sharing the <b>Public Key</b> widely; anyone with access to this <b>Public Key</b> can access your feed data. 
li The feed's <b>Private Key</b> is required in order to post new data to the feed.  This key was provided when the feed was created. (See the <a href="#adding">Adding feed data</a> section below.)
li The <b>Home Page</b> is a link to this page; a feed home page is always '#{base_url}/data/[Feed Public Key]'.
